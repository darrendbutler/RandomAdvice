# RandomAdvice
An android app to that gives random,always fun, and somtimes useful advice.

## Inspiration
I usually deal with a lot of general anxiety and I don't know what to do, so I figured I would make an app that would give me advice that's either useful or so funny that I'd stop being anxious.

## What it does
Gives random advice at the press of a button!

## How we built it
I built it using Android Studio, the public Advice Slip API, and the HTTP Request Library from CodePath.

## Challenges we ran into
I had trouble creating a consistent layout because the advice would normally be of different length.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This was my first time building an android app without a tutorial!

## What we learned
I learned the differences between the types of layouts and deepened my understanding of HTTP Request and parsing JSON.

## What's next for Advise Me!
1. Allow user to save their favorite advice.
2. Use computer vision to give advice on object
